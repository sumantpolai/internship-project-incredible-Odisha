        <h2 className="content1">
          Ravenshaw University, formerly known as Ravenshaw College, is a
          co-educational state university situated in Cuttack, Odisha on the
          eastern coast of India. Founded as Ravenshaw College in 1868, the
          institution became a university in 2006.[2] The university has nine
          schools, thirty three academic departments and a student enrolment of
          nearly 8,000. It is one of the oldest educational institutes in the
          country and its history is synonymous with the history of modern
          Odisha.

          <b> -: Early years :-</b>
          <br />
          After the great famine of 1866, the people of Odisha and some liberal
          Britons wanted to start a college at Cuttack. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw,
          officiating commissioner of Odisha Division made the government of
          Bengal realise the difficulties of Oriya students in getting college
          educations and succeeded in obtaining permission to start collegiate
          classes in the Cuttack Zilla School. Thus the first college in Odisha
          was born in January 1868 with intermediate classes and six students.
          Commissioner Ravenshaw proposed to convert the Collegiate School into
          a full-fledged degree college. The government of Bengal accepted the
          demand with the condition that a public contribution of Rs.30,000 be
          deposited for the proposed college. Ravenshaw took up the matter as an
          object of personal interest and guaranteed the collection of the
          required amount. H.
          <br />
          Woodrew, DPI of Bengal supported Ravenshaw. H. J. Reynolds, secretary
          to the government of Bengal requested the government of India to
          sanction the incidental charges and the post of the principal on the
          additional condition of meeting half the monthly expenses by public
          donation. Due to Ravenshaw's efforts and the financial support of
          Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, HH Shri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo, the college
          department of the Collegiate School was converted in 1876 to a
          full-fledged Government Degree College bearing the name Cuttack
          College affiliated to the University of Calcutta. Samuel Ager was
          appointed as the first principal. The college had only 19 students.
          H.H. Sri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo donated Rs. 20,000 as a permanent
          endowment which almost fulfilled the condition imposed by the
          government for public contribution. On his insistence the name was
          changed to Ravenshaw College in 1878 after Thomas Edward Ravenshaw to
          commemorate his services to the cause of education in Odisha. The
          college was granted permanent status by 1881. Growth in the initial
          days was slow. Altogether 94 graduates were produced by the closing
          year of the 19th century and the student strength had increased to 97.
          Science stream remained confined only to intermediate level until 1912
          when Bihar and Odisha were separated from Bengal.it is the college
          where many of our freedom fighters have completed their graduation.

          university has acquired another 140 acres of land on the bank of the
          river Mahanadi, to build the second campus for its new disciplines of
          management and applied sciences. The foundation stone of the new
          campus at Naraj has been laid by Naveen Patnaik.[7]
