          <b>-: History :-</b>
          <br />
          Mahendragiri is associated with the Ramayana as Mahendra Parvata
          (mountain). It is a 'Kula Parvata' along with Malaya, Sahyadri,
          Parijatra, Shuktiman, Vindhya and Malyavaan.[4] In the Puranas and
          Ramayana It is said that Parashurama was meditating on Mahendragiri
          when Lord Rama broke the sacred bow of Shiva.
          <br />
          Mahendragiri is situated in Gajapati district, Odisha. Legend says
          that it is the place where Lord Parashurama, a chiranjeevi stays
          eternally and performs tapasya. Parashurama is the sixth avatar of
          Vishnu in Hinduism and he is one of the Chiranjeevis (long - lived),
          who will appear at the end of the Kali yuga to be the guru of Vishnu's
          tenth and last avatar, Kalki. He carried a number of traits, which
          included aggression, warfare and valor; also, serenity, prudence and
          patience. He retired in the Mahendra Mountains, according to chapter
          2.3.47 of the Bhagavata Purana.[6] He is the only Vishnu avatar who
          never dies, never returns to abstract Vishnu and lives in meditative
          retirement. Further, he is the only Vishnu avatar that co-exists with
          other Vishnu avatars Rama and Krishna in some versions of the Ramayana
          and Mahabharata respectively.[7][8] Temples, which are said to be
          built by the Pandavas are present. The main festival observed here is
          Shivaratri.
