          <b> -: History :-</b>
          <br />
          Excavation at villages nearby by Balasore has given evidence for three
          distinct cultural phases of human settlements, viz., Chalcolithic
          (2000–1000 BCE), Iron Age (1000–400 BCE) and early historic period
          (400–200 BCE)
          <br />
          The British East India Company (EIC) established a factory at Balasore
          in 1633. In 1719, the Trieste Company merchants established a trading
          post there.[8] As Calcutta rose in importance, Balasore became the
          center for river pilot services for vessels seeking to ascend the
          Hooghli River. The city was bombarded by forces of the East India
          Company during the Anglo-Mughal War in 1686 however the company was
          repulsed by the Mughal forces.

        <h2 className="deities1">
          <b> -:Geography :-</b>
          <br />
          Balasore, located in the Indian state of Odisha, has a tropical
          climate characterised by high humidity and hot temperatures throughout
          the year. The summers, which last from March to May, are particularly
          hot, with temperatures often reaching up to 40 °C. May is typically
          the hottest month of the year in Balasore.
          <br />
          Monsoon season starts in June and lasts until September, bringing
          heavy rainfall to the city. Balasore's proximity to the Bay of Bengal
          makes it vulnerable to cyclonic storms during the monsoon season.
          However, the city generally enjoys pleasant evenings with cool breeze
          most of the times, providing relief from the heat during the summer
          months.
