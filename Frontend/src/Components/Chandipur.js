        <h2 className="content1">
          Chandipur, is a resort town in Balasore District, Odisha, India. The
          town is located on the shore of Bay of Bengal and is approximately 16
          kilometers from the Balasore Railway Station. Chandipur beach is
          unique in a way that the water recedes up to 5 kilometers during the
          ebb tide. Due to its unique circumstances, the beach supports
          biodiversity. Horseshoe crab is also found here on the beach towards
          Mirzapur, the nearby fishing market and community at the confluence of
          the Budhabalanga River (Balaramgadi). It is a suitable picnic spot.
          One of Odisha Tourism's Panthanivas (guest house) is situated here.
