        <h2 className="content1">
          The Dhamra Port is a port in Bhadrak district, Odisha, India, on the
          shore of the Bay of Bengal about seven kilometres from Dhamra town.
          The agreement to develop the port was signed in April 1998. The Dhamra
          Port Company Limited (DPCL) was formed as a result of a 50:50 joint
          venture between Larsen & Toubro and TATA Steel to run the port.[1] The
          Port received its first vessel on 8 February 2010 and the first
          commercial vessel on 10 April 2011.[2] The Port has an initial
          capacity of 25 million tonnes annually, eventually growing to 80
          million tonnes annually.[3] Greenpeace has opposed the project,
          claiming it threatens nearby protected areas and endangered species
          such as the olive ridley turtle[4]

          <b>-: Objectives :-</b>
          <br />
          The port was taken over by Adani Port in June 2014.[5] The port will
          be used to export iron ore from a nearby mineral belt.[6] The Odisha
          government has plans to develop related industries near the new port,
          including a shipbuilding yard and a petrochemical and gas-based
          manufacturing hub. A special investment region has been proposed for
          Dhamara, and a zoning plan is being prepared to cover housing, health
          services and other urban infrastructure.
          <br />A new airport/Airstrip is approved by government of odisha near
          Dhamra port of around 500 acres.[8] National Waterway 5 project of
          connecting water channels between Pardeep and Dhamra is also in the
          construction stage by IWAI. A proposed 4 lane NH is also in DPR stage
          connecting to Dhamra port from Jamujhadi NH16. A tea processing unit
          is planned to have a unit in Dhamra port.

          <b> -: Construction :-</b>
          <br />
          During the year 1997 Government of Odisha invited M/s International
          Seaports dredging Private Limited (ISDPL) to explore and evaluate the
          possibilities of expanding the minor port at Dhamra with modern
          contemporary facilities. After a site visit and preliminary
          discussions/evaluation, selected Dhamra port for further expansion.
          Based on a review of studies undertaken by the Government of Odisha
          and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai, as well as a
          preliminary field analysis ISDPL proposed a broad project approach. On
          this basis ISDPL and Government of Odisha entered into a memorandum of
          understanding on 31.03.97 for the expansion and development of the
          existing port of Dharma on Built Own Operate Share and Transfer
          (BOOST) basis. ISDPL signed the concession agreement with the
          Government of Odisha on 02.04.98. Thereby heralding a new era in the
          infrastructure development in the port sector of the country with
          private participation. The proposed Dhamra port is a minor port in the
          northern part of the state of Orissa situated about 62 km east of
          Bhadrak station on the Howrah-Chennai East coast mainline. Dhamra port
          is to be developed as a most modern all-weather, deep-water port,
          capable of handling all modern shipping efficiently and cost
          effectively on world standard norms. Development of a suitable road
          and rail system linking the port with the national network is also
          considered a vital and integral part of the project. ISDPL proposed
          that the railway line between Dhamra port and Bhadrak would be built
          on private siding terms, which is subsequently granted by Railway
          board. In the meantime, ISDPL had withdrawn its participation from
          this project due to difficulties in the acquisition of land required
          for the proposed rail links between Bhadrak and Renital stations and
          in the change in the composition of the companies investing in the
          project. This resulted in suspension of activities. In the year 2005,
          a joint venture company formed in the name of Dhamra Port company
          limited with 50-50 partnership of Larsen & Toubro Limited and Tata
          steels limited.
          <br />
          The planned port would have 13 berths with the capacity to handle 83
          million tonnes annually. In the first phase, two 350 meter berths have
          been built to handle import of coking coal, steam coal, thermal coal
          and limestone, and export of iron ore and steel, with fully mechanized
          cargo handling. An 18 km navigational channel lets ships with an
          18-meter draught use the port. Capacity in the first phase is 15.25
          million tonnes of imported coal and limestone and 9.75 million tonnes
          of exported ore and steel.
