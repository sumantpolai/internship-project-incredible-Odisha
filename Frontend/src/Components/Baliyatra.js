          Bāli Jātrā, (Odia: ବାଲିଯାତ୍ରା, lit. 'Voyage to Bali') pronounced [bali
          dʒat̪ɾa], is the major Boita Bandana festival held at Cuttack on Kartik
          Purnima and lasts for 7 days or more. It is considered to be one of
          Asia's largest open trade fair.[2][3] The festival is held in Odisha
          (a state in eastern India), in the city of Cuttack at Gadagadia Ghata
          of the Mahanadi river, to mark the day when ancient Sadhabas (Odia
          mariners) would set sail to distant lands of Bali, as well as Java (at
          the time of the voyage known as "Yawadvipa"), Sumatra, Borneo (all in
          Indonesia), and Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) for trade and cultural
          expansion. To commemorate this, the festival is celebrated every year
          from the day of Kartika Purnima (full moon day of the month of
          Kartika) according to the Odia calendar.

          <b> -: Overview :-</b>
          <br />
          On Kartika Purnima, which comes around the end of October and
          November, people of Odisha gather near banks of Mahanadi, Brahmani
          river, other river banks, ponds, water tanks and sea shores to float
          miniature toy boats, made of colored paper, dried banana tree barks,
          and cork, as a symbolic gesture of their ancestors' voyage. These toy
          boats, usually launched early in the morning contain traditional paan
          and small oil lamps, which are lit and placed inside them, to provide
          an attractive sight during the festival
          <br />
          People sing a song Aa ka ma boi, pan gua thoi... to remember the early
          maritime history of Odisha. The song tells about four months that are
          important for marine merchants of Kalinga (the earlier name of
          Odisha). This festival is also celebrated with great fanfare in
          Paradeep. Bali Jatra bears testimony to the rich maritime legacy of
          ancient Odisha. This is the specific time that was considered
          auspicious by the Sadhabas to begin their voyage in vessels called
          Boitas.
